    <h2>Hello, I'm Zach</h2>
      <p>I am excited to embark on a new career path as a software engineer after spending the last 12 years in sales. My decision to make this transition was motivated by my desire to spend more quality time with my family.</p>
      <p>I am located in a serene area just outside of Pittsburgh, where I look forward to contributing to the vibrant tech community and pursuing my passion for software development.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have always had an interest in coding, and I have recently taken the leap to learn web development. I am passionate about this field and enjoy the process of constantly learning and improving my skills. Additionally, my background in sales has given me valuable experience in collaborating with others and working towards common goals.</p>
    <p>When I'm not pursuing my passion for web development or working with others, I enjoy spending time with my family. My wife and daughter are the most important things to me, and I cherish every moment we spend together.</p> 
    <p>In my free time I enjoy: </p>
